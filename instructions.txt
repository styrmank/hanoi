How to play the game:

The goal of the game is to get all the blocks from
the starting tower (red) to the goal tower (yellow).
Blocks can be moved one by one and placed on a tower
only and only if the tower doesn't already have a block that's
smaller than the currently selected one.
If the block can't be placed it'll turn black and won't
allow placement.
The block the cursor currently points to/is selected
is indicated by its white color.
Blocks change their color in accordance to the tower.
The cursor and selected block can can be moved with either
the A key and <- button or D key and -> button to the left or right
respectively. The W key and Select button select a block if one 
isn't already selected. The S key and Place button place 
the currently selected block down if possible.
The best score so far (shortest time) is saved in a text file
and can be viewed on the start menu by pushing the high score button.
The time passed in the current game is shown live in the lower
right corner of the game.
Players can adjust the amount of blocks in the game by
between 3 and 12 in the start menu.
To start the game, press start.
